# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.4
- Cleaned up the makefile

## 0.3.3
- New behaviour, instead of `chromflock`, do `chromflock init`.
- `cc2cpm` is baked into the binary `chromflock` and renamed to
  `hic2cpm`
- `sprite2cpm`, `any2string` and `string2any` also moved to `chromflock`.
- documentation is based on markdown instead of troff.

## 0.3.2
 - Cleaned up the makefile.
 - Added **--version** argument to **aflock**, **mflock**, and **cc2cpm**
 - Fixed typos in the **cc2cpm** documentation.

## 0.3.1
 - Added script to make a deb package for Ubuntu. That is the
   preferred way to install from now.
