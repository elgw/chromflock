## Limitations


## Crash behavior
The programs typically crashes when they run out of memory or are
unable to read/write files.

## Files
```
# Initial MATLAB prototype for the M-step
src/mstep.m

# Implementation of the 'error' function and it's gradient:
src/functional.*
```

## To Do
Read/write contacts as lists instead of dense matrices.
